			<h2>Singular Spectrum Analysis with R</h2>

			<p><em>by Nina Golyandina, Anton Korobeynikov, Anatoly Zhigljavsky </em><br/>

			<a href="http://springer.com">Springer</a>, 2017
			</p>
			<p class = "description"> Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)
			is a well-known  methodology of analysis and forecasting of time series
			 and, since quite recently, of digital images and other objects  which are not necessarily
			of planar or rectangular shape  and may contain gaps. </p>

			<p class = "description"> This book has the following goals:
				<ul>
					<li> to present the up-to-date SSA methodology, including multidimensional extensions,
			in the form accessible to a very wide circle of users,</li>
					<li> to interconnect a variety of versions of SSA into a single  tool,</li>
					<li> to show the diverse tasks  that SSA can be used for,</li>
					<li> to formally describe  the main SSA methods and algorithms, and</li>
					<li>to make a tutorial on the "Rssa" package.</li>
				</ul>
